# Grant Robinson's Heredity Project
This is a simple AI project that uses probability to infer the likelihood that each person in a family has a given gene, and whether
or not they exhibit a trait associated with the gene based on a family tree and known evidence.
## What this project is
<ul>
  <li>Project in CS50's Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python</li>
  <li> Computes the probability distribution of how many copies of a gene each person has (0, 1, or 2), and if each person exhibits the trait (Yes/No)
  </li>
  <li>Produces normalized distributions for each person after calculating the probability distribution for each event</li>
</ul>
## How to use it
<ul>
  <li>Only requires Python 3 (any version of it is fine)</li>
</ul>
